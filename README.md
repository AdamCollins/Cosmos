A Lightweight forum for university students written in NodeJS and MongoDB


## Building Cosmos
I created Cosmos as a fun project to improve my ASP.NET, C# and SQL Database skills. However, after a week of building using this stack I decided to build with more modern stack consisting of Node.js and MongoDB.
This project allowed me to practice building full-stack applications using modern frameworks in which I could sharpen both my front-end and back-end development skills.

## Name
I chose the name Cosmos because I enjoy astronomy and referring to yourself as a cosmonaut sounds 10x more badass than an astronaut.

## Built With
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## License
Distributed under the MIT license.
